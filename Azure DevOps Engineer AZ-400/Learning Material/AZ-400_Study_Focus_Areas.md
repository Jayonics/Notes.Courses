#### 2. Design and Implement Processes and Communications (10-15% of exam)
**Performance:** 15/19 questions = **78.9%** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Specific Weaknesses Identified:**

##### DevOps Metrics Understanding
- **Issue:** Practice Test 5, Question 3 - Confused Cycle Time vs Lead Time
- **Problem:** Selected Cycle Time instead of Lead Time for commit-to-production measurement
- **Key Distinction:**
  - **Lead Time:** Code commit ‚Üí Production deployment (CORRECT for the question)
  - **Cycle Time:** Work item start ‚Üí Work item completion

**üéØ Focused Study Plan:**

**DevOps Metrics Mastery:**
- Study the DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, Change Failure Rate)
- Understand when to use each metric for different scenarios
- Practice Azure DevOps Analytics and reporting

**Microsoft Learn Resources:**
- [Plan and track work using Azure Boards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/plan-track-work-azure-boards/)
